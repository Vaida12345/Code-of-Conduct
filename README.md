# Code-of-Conduct

I am hereby announce that none of my projects on GitHub or on the App Store would collect any personal data.

Some of my projects would use iCloud service to sync data across multiple devices, these documents would not and cannot be accessed by myself in any way.

The projects I created would try to keep only the minimum amount of user information on your own computer. These are mostly configuration files with the goal of improving user experience. These files would not be uploaded or collected in any way.
