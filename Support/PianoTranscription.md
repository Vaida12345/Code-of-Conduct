# FAQs on FinderQuery

## How does it work?
The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/bytedance/piano_transcription). Their model was translated to CoreML Model, which is then used in this App.


## How to configure the post processor?
After the inference is finished, long press on an audio (or right-click on Mac), and choose "tune". Don't forget to save the file by clicking on the *download* button on the top right corner of the screen!

## Where is my converted midi?
On Mac: You can view your file by clicking on the tiny *folder* icon when the inference is finished.
On iPhone / iPad: The files can be found at the *File* App > On My iPhone > PianoTranscription.

## How can I open the midi?
This App only provides a way to convert to midi, it is not a midi editor.
Another App is required. Personally I would recommand *GarageBand* or *Logic Pro* by Apple.
On Mac: Double click on the file to open with the default Application.
on iPhone / iPad using *GarageBand*: Create a new project > choose *Loop* > choose *Files* > choose *browse from the Files app* > choose the file > drag the file to a track. Please refer to Apple's *GarageBand User Guide* for more information.

## Does this App require internet connection?
No! Everything is done on your local device, this App works completely offline. Hence, nothing is collected, and nothing leaves your device.
